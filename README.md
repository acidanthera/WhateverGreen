This is for Alienware Area 51m r2 with rx5700m only !!!!

This repo will fix the backlight adjust problem of this machine, see the code for more detail.

Still have two problem:

First, dim screen when on battery seems not working.

Second, the backlight control sometimes does not work, and have to boot into Windows to reset the brightness first then reboot to Mac OS to make it work. Don't know the reason, may be need more initialize or reset code. Will study it in the future when I have time.

It seems cold boot into MacOS will cause this problem. And it will not going to work again until boot into Windows to reset the brightness. And the most interesting thing is, if you boot into Ubuntu when this problem occurs, it will fail to boot and show this error.

No clue how to fix this. Please help if you have any ideas!
